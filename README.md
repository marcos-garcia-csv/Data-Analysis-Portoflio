I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques in my free time and always seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

# Portfolio Projects
## Python

### Analyzing global video game sales over time
**Code:** [`Analyzing global video game sales over time.ipynb`](https://github.com/Fuegillo/Portofio-Projects-/blob/main/Video%20Games%20sales%20analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** To identify the years with the highest game sales and determine the top games, genres, publishers, and platforms based on global sales.

**Description:** This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of video game sales spanning from 1980 to 2020. The dataset includes key information such as the ranking of games based on global sales, game titles, release years, genres, platforms, and other relevant details.

In this project, I loaded, cleaned, and processed the dataset to prepare it for analysis. I then conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine various aspects of the dataset, with a particular emphasis on understanding trends and patterns in global sales.

**Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

# Portfolio Projects
## SQL

### Analyzing SuperStore Sales
**Code:** [`Store Sales`](https://github.com/marcos-garcia-csv/Portofio-Projects-/blob/main/SuperStore%20Sales.sql)

**Description:** This project involves analyzing a comprehensive sales dataset spanning multiple years to extract valuable business insights. Using SQL, I explored the data to identify trends, such as seasonal sales patterns, high-performing products, and regional performance metrics. The analysis also includes calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) like total sales, and average sales, and identifying top-selling categories and regions.

**Goal:** The objective of this project is to analyze multi-year sales data to uncover meaningful insights that can drive business decisions. The project focuses on identifying sales trends, seasonal patterns, high-performing products, and regions, as well as analyzing overall business growth over time. By leveraging SQL for data exploration and analysis, this project aims to showcase proficiency in querying, transforming, and aggregating data to derive actionable insights.

**Skills:**  
  - Querying and filtering data.  
  - Grouping and aggregating for insights.  
  - Sorting and ranking for detailed analysis.

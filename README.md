## About

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Marcos!

I'm a Data Analyst passionate about transforming data into actionable insights. I have hands-on experience with SQL, Python, Excel, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau. My work involves uncovering patterns and trends that drive decision-making and business growth.

I am currently studying Data Science & Analytics at Instituto TecnolÃ³gico de Las AmÃ©ricas (ITLA)

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques in my free time and always seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

Please take a look at my work below:

# Portfolio Projects
## SQL

### Analyzing SuperStore Sales
**Code:** [`Store Sales`](https://github.com/marcos-garcia-csv/Portofio-Projects-/blob/main/SuperStore%20Sales.sql)

**Description:** This project involves analyzing a comprehensive sales dataset spanning multiple years to extract valuable business insights. Using SQL, I explored the data to identify trends, such as seasonal sales patterns, high-performing products, and regional performance metrics. The analysis also includes calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) like total sales, and average sales, and identifying top-selling categories and regions.

**Goal:** The objective of this project is to analyze multi-year sales data to uncover meaningful insights that can drive business decisions. The project focuses on identifying sales trends, seasonal patterns, high-performing products, and regions, as well as analyzing overall business growth over time. By leveraging SQL for data exploration and analysis, this project aims to showcase proficiency in querying, transforming, and aggregating data to derive actionable insights.

**Skills:**  
  - Querying and filtering data.  
  - Grouping and aggregating for insights.  
  - Sorting and ranking for detailed analysis.

## Tableau

This dashboard provides an interactive exploration of the relationship between life expectancy and GDP over time, helping users identify patterns, 
disparities among countries, and potential correlations between economic growth and health outcomes.

### Steps followed:

- Step 1: Imported CSV datasets into Power BI Desktop.
- Step 2: Used Power Query Editor for data cleaning, including removing unnecessary columns, blank rows, and restructuring data.
- Step 3: Created helper tables to establish relationships between datasets and enable dynamic filtering.
- Step 4: Designed the dashboard layout, incorporating a cohesive theme.
- Step 5: Built measures to calculate average life expectancy for males, females, and both sexes.
- Step 6: Added diverse visuals, including line and bar charts, cards, slicers, and a world map to enhance data exploration.

The dashboard combines a clean design with interactive functionality, making it a powerful tool for exploring the interplay between GDP and life expectancy worldwide.
